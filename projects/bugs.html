        An webapp for me to track bugs and issues within my projects that I'm building, so I get into good practice but also have all this information in one place.

        Was able to refine my react and next.js skills to this project, but the main focus was to build users with associated privileges. These users can only access projects they are linked too and not others, this was achived using fauna as a database and security service and their own query/function language FQL. Had to update MUI version part way through, this was a new skill I had to develop of following documentation for upgrades etc...
