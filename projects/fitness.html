      <h3>
          I build a workout program and tracking site for two personal trainers.
      </h3>
      <p>
        They wanted a landing page and ability for people to follow a bespoke fitness plan designed for them. They wanted their users to be able to track workout info from day to day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Required a more complex stack: Next.js and materialUI is used for all pages, FaunaDB for keeping user workout history. You can use the login of 'dummyUser' to explore the site, this account is read only and nothing will be saved to the server if you use this account.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Strengths of this project:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Easy to follow fitness program in user area</li>
        <li>User can upload and track workout programs developed for them</li>
        <li>Most complex site and data structures I have worked with, complex form in admin area that previews what workout will look like to user.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Weaknesses of this project:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Speed - some areas don't load as quickly as they could</li>
        <li>Landing page could do with some refinement to design</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        What I intend to do next:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Look at page loading times for user area, add in some server rendering for user areas</li>
        <li>Continue to refine design of landing page</li>
        <li>Add in ability for clients to pay through the site</li>
      </ul>
