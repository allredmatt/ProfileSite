# ProfileSite
My personal profile site

I wanted a site to showcase my skill and projects, with an easiy way for people to find out more about me and what I've self taught as a developer.

I started building this site with no javascript or any frameworks, just good old fashioned HTML and CSS.

In the future I might make a more complex backend to host blogs etc... on. But for now this is fine!
